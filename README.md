# YEWOMI - An expense sharing web app

Yewomi is an expense sharing web app, allowing you to create groups with friends, family or house mates. You can add everyday expenses that you've paid for, allocating amounts that the other members 'owe'. As they do the same, owed amounts will begin to counter-act eachother until settled.

## 🧰 Wireframes

I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to design my initial Wireframe concept frames

Here is the initial concept draft:

![Wireframe 1](/client/src/assets/Wireframe_1.png "Wireframe 1")

I am pleased that my original concept database design ended up being the end-product. Allocating extra time to the theoretical planning definitely proved useful in saving time down the line!

## 🐞 Bugs

- React state will fail if user tries to view a transaction created prior to them accepting the group invite. Current workaround - ensure all team members have accepted the group invites, prior to adding expenses.

## 💡 Key learning

- Organisation & Structure is so important! Learning the right habits for folder and file organisation will make future projects so much easier.
